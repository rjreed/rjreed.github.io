It's a series of static pages built using a Node JS static site generator. The content is authored using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

All of the code that went into building this site is free to use under the [MIT License](https://github.com/rjreed/rjreed.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE) and is hosted at the GitHub link above. You can use any of it however you want without reference to me whatsoever.
